## About

**This requires [Wails](https://wails.io)**

Wails svelte template to feature i18n in frontend

Start a wails project using `wails init -n "project name" -t "https://github.com/Deepfried-Chips/wails-svelte-i18n"`

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
