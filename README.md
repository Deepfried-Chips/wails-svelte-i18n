## About

Wails svelte template to feature i18n in frontend

==This requires [Wails](https://wails.io)==

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.
